- Create a new INFO result, lower-priority than WARN or FAIL, but that
  might tell you interesting things about the server.  (E.g., whether it
  supports some optional feature.  In which case further tests may
  depend on it in some way.) ?

- make block/char/etc tests more automatic: use an INFO level test to
  probe whether the server allows creating these things as a regular
  user, or as root, give an INFO level result, and make further tests
  depend on this somehow.

- Search for other similar pieces between 4.0 and 4.1 which can obviously be
  shared--any .x files?
- compound length problem:
	- everything should start with putfh of root of testdir rather
	  than of root!
		- first make use_obj an NFS4Client method, or replace it
		  by one that is.
		- then teach it to do absolute lookups (paths beginning
		  with one '' component) and lookups relative to test root,
		  simultaneously making all paths absolute (probably
		  that's just --useXXX paths and homedir path).
		- then slowly start using relative paths in various
		  places.
	- break up lookup into multiple compounds?
	- consider also whether server could allow more.
- Also track down remaining failures, reexamine skip lists.
- Basic v4.0 DRC test.
