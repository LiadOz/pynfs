2007-04-03: Create a usable client framework

	        need to filter parent.
	Add RPCReply Exception, which greatly simplifies some things
2007-04-05: Debug from code reorg caused by RPCReply
	Add timeout to listen. (Eases debugging, otherwise client

	Work on AuthGss enough to mount server with -osec=krb5
2007-04-06: Finish AuthGss.check_auth()
	Add secure_data/unsecure_data to AuthGss.  This enables -osec=krb5i,
	        but seems to be a problem with gssapi.unwrap, so no krb5p.
	Create a rough block.py

2007-04-10: Work on AuthGss.init_cred, reorg some code to handle

	Add EXCHANGE_ID tests.
2007-04-24: Pass principal down from rpc layer to nfs4 server.
	Add some CREATE_SESSION tests.
	Add some SEQUENCE tests.
2007-04-26: Add StateTable, and a minimalist op_open() to test it.
	Have op_open do a CB_NULL to minimally test delgation framework.
2007-04-27: Fix StateTable by adding FileState layer.
2007-04-30: Rewrite state again, put it into nfs4state.py.
	Start real delegation framework.
2007-05-01: More delegation framework work.
2007-05-02: Write callback server framework.

2007-05-17: Add REMOVE and CLOSE to server.
	Add _maketree to testserver
2007-05-18: Fix a sync bug - needed to propagate fattr4_change up mounts
	Fix bug with fattr4_time_*_set - settime4 can't be pickled
	Make fattr4_size work
	Can now touch/echo/cat a file, and have it persist correctly through
	     server reboot.
	Fill out EXCHANGE_ID and its tests.
	Fix TODO's in CREATE_SESSION tests.
	Update OPEN tests
2007-05-21: Sketch out ConfigFS
